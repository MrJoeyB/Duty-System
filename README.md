# FiveM Duty System

Description

The FiveM Duty System is a standalone resource designed for roleplaying servers. It provides essential features for managing on-duty status, logging duty-related actions, and ensuring smooth roleplay experiences for players.

### Features

1. **Clock-In and Clock-Out Commands:**
   - Players can use `/duty [department] [badge]` to start their duty shift.
   - `/clockout` allows players to end their duty shift and calculates the duration.

2. **On-Duty Status:**
   - Players can check who is currently on duty using the `/onduty` command.
   - The system tracks on-duty players and their respective departments.

3. **Kick-Off Duty:**
   - Admins or supervisors can use `/kickoffduty [playerID]` to remove a player from duty.
   - Discord webhook logs capture these actions for transparency.
